                October has started. Ahhhh! I can't believe how time has
                both gone so slowly and yet so quickly. We have Friday off this
                week, and I'm jumping for joy, as I clutch my Macbook Pro close
                to me as I do so.

                But before the three-day weekend, we got a little introduction to
                JavaScript and jQuery. I was pretty excited about this, and I
                find I'm better at googling and collaging together scraps of
                code together in JS than I do in Ruby. I don't know if this is
                because I like to create webpages or if it's just because I have
                more exposure to JS than I do to Ruby or if it's a combination
                of both, even though JS looks kind of like gibberish to me
                most of the time.
